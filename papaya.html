					<p>Papaya fruit is a berry with a thin, smooth exocarp (peel) and thick, fleshy mesocarp (pulp)
						surrounding an open cavity containing many small seeds. Fruit may be globose, ovoid, obovoid,
						and pyriform, 2 1/3 inch to 18 inches (7–35 cm) long, and ½ to 22 lbs (0.250–10 kg) in weight.

						In addition, some plants may produce more than one type of flower and exhibit different degrees
						of male or femaleness. This may be triggered by temperature, changing day length, and soil
						moisture availability. Female plants produce medium to large round-shaped fruit of good quality
						and a large seed cavity. Bisexual plants produce small to large elongated fruit of good quality
						and a smaller seed cavity. Male plants with bisexual flowers may produce a few, elongated,
						pear-shaped, poor quality fruit.

					<h2>Prepare</h2>
					<p>Properly planting a papaya tree is one of the most important steps in successfully establishing
						and growing a strong, productive tree. Some nurseries offer papaya plants and the first step is
						to choose a healthy nursery tree. Commonly, nursery papaya trees are grown in 1- to 3-gallon
						containers and trees stand 6 inches to 2 ft tall. Large trees in smaller containers should be
						avoided as the root system may be "root bound." This means all the available space in the
						container has been filled with roots to the point that the tap root is growing along the edge of
						the container in a circular fashion. Root bound root systems may not grow properly once planted
						in the ground.

						Inspect the tree for insect pests and diseases and inspect the trunk of the tree for wounds and
						constrictions. Select a healthy tree and water it regularly in preparation for planting in the
						ground.

					</p>

					<h2>Grow</h2>
					<p>Watering is essential for best papaya plant growth and fruit production. Papaya plants that lack
						water (drought stress) may drop flowers, leaves, and young fruit and produce small fruit of low
						sugar content.

						Plants growing in sandy or rocky soils that are well drained and do not hold much water should
						be watered every other day or every day during hot, dry conditions and less often during cool
						parts of the year (late fall, winter). Plants growing in soil with a capacity to hold water
						(loams, sandy loams) should not be overwatered and therefore should be watered at 3- to 4-day
						intervals, especially during hot weather.Mulching papaya trees in the home landscape helps
						retain soil moisture, reduces weed problems adjacent to the tree trunk, and improves the soil
						near the surface. Mulch with a 2- to 6-inch (5- to 15-cm) layer of bark, wood chips, or similar
						mulch material. Keep mulch 8–12 inches (20–30 cm) from the trunk.
					</p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Harvest</h2>
					<p>Papaya fruit may be harvested green for use as a vegetable and ripe when full yellow to orange
						color develops on the peel. Generally, fruit may be picked when yellow color covers 1/10th to
						1/3rd of the surface peel, however, greater color development of the fruit while on the tree
						increases fruit sugar content. After picking, fruit should be placed at room temperature to
						fully ripen before being stored in the refrigerator. Ripe fruit will keep up to 4 to 7 days.</p>
