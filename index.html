							<h1>Become the best gardener that you can be</h1>
						</header>
						<p>Whether you’re tired of running to the store for tomatoes or want to grow flowers to beautify
							your home, there are many benefits to learning how to garden. Proper tactics for nurturing
							plant life can save you time and money, and also become a highly-enjoyable hobby. If you’re
							starting with nothing, you may ask, “How can I learn gardening?” It does not require any
							special kind of person — just practice, supplies, and knowledge. </p>

							<h3>Basil</h3>
							<p>Basil is a tropical herb, and plants need sun and heat to thrive. Give it a spot that
								receives six to eight hours of sun daily, except in the South and Southwest, where
								afternoon shade is a must.

								Basil needs moist, nutrient-rich soil that drains well. Here's how to make sure you're
								getting the best growing environment possible</p>

							<a href="cucumber.html" class="image"><img src="images/cucumber.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h3>Cucumbers</h3>
							<p>Cucumbers need warm, fertile soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.8, although they will tolerate a
								bit more alkaline soil to 7.6. To improve the soil and help create the root environment
								needed for a big harvest, work several inches of soil into the top few inches of your
								existing garden soil.</p>

							<a href="bell_pepper.html" class="image"><img src="images/bell_pepper.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h3>Bell Peppers</h3>
							<p>Site preparation begins with finding the right spot. Peppers need full sun to grow
								properly — at least six hours of direct light each day. Soil should be well drained so
								that roots don't become waterlogged, but also moisture retentive to prevent draining
								out. </p>

							<h3>Salak</h3>
							<p>Salak are dioecious, meaning each individual plant either produces female flowers or male
								flowers, although there are some varieties of Salak which are known to be self fertile.
								In order to balance pollination and production it is recommended to have 3 female plants
								for every 1 male plant in an orchard.</p>

							<h3>Papaya</h3>
							<p>Papaya plants are susceptible to wind damage and will not establish or grow well in
								continuously windy areas. Papaya plants with a large amount of developing fruit are very
								susceptible to toppling due to high winds. Therefore, plants should be planted in
								wind-protected areas of the landscape.</p>

							<h3>Rambutan</h3>
							<p>Fertilize with a food that is 55g potash, 115g phosphate, and 60g urea at six months and
								again at one year of age. At two years old, fertilize with a food that is 165g potash,
								345g phosphate, and 180g urea. At the third year, apply 275g potash, 575g phosphate, and
								300g urea every six months.</p>
