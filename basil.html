					<p>Basil is an annual herb that thrives when summer heat arrives, pumping out fragrantly delicious
						leaves. Planting basil typically yields a harvest of leaves flavored with hints of anise, mint,
						and clove, but you can also try growing basil with tones of cinnamon or lemon. You'll find
						leaves in a variety of sizes, flavors and colors. If you like cooking Italian and Asian cuisine,
						you should try growing basil. Here's how to grow basil in your home garden.
					</p>

					<h2>Plant</h2>
					<p>
						The fastest way to reach harvest time when growing basil is to plant young plants, such as the
						vigorous, productive ones from Bonnie Plants®. You can actually begin harvesting immediately
						after planting!

						If you would prefer to grow seeds, sow them directly into soil outdoors after all danger of
						frost has passed, or start seeds indoors about six to eight weeks before your region's average
						last frost date, using a quality potting mixture. Sow basil seeds one-half inch
						deep, placing 3 seeds per seed-starting cell. Germination takes 7 to 14 days. After the first
						set of true leaves appear (these will be teardrop-shaped), thin seedlings by using scissors to
						snip off all but the strongest seedling in each cell. If necessary, transplant seedlings into
						larger containers until they're ready to go into the garden. In the garden, space plants 12 to
						18 inches apart, depending on variety. If starting seeds directly in the garden, sow seeds
						one-half inch deep, one inch apart, and thin to 12-18 inches apart after the first set of true
						leaves appears. If growing in a pot, choose a 12-inch container or larger.

						Water well after planting.</p>

					<h2>Grow</h2>
					<p>Pinch basil plants when they're 4 to 6 inches tall, removing the center set of leaves at the
						growing tip. This will encourage branching, resulting in a bushier plant. Pinch basil shoots
						again when they have added another 6 inches of growth.

						Basil plants need consistent soil moisture to yield well. When the top inch of the soil is dry,
						you need to water. Containers need to be watered more frequently than in-ground gardens.

						Sometime around mid-summer, plants will start flowering. As soon as you see a flower bud, pinch
						it off. If flowers are allowed to grow, leaf flavor will change (not for the better) and leaf
						production will start to slow.

						Basil is extremely cold-sensitive, typically showing signs of cold damage at temperatures below
						42°F. Harvest plants heavily if frost is in the forecast.
					</p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Harvest</h2>
					<p>Start harvesting individual leaves as soon as plants are 6 to 8 inches high. Pinch individual
						leaves or snip stems. To store basil inside for a few days, keep freshly clipped sprigs in a
						vase of water at room temperature. Do not refrigerate basil; the cold air turns leaves brown.

						You can, however, freeze chopped basil in cubes of water or olive oil.</p>
