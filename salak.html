					<p>Salak palm or snake fruit (Salacca edulis or Salacca zalacca) is a high value understory species
						for tropical agroforestry plantings. Salak palm is native to southeast Asia, where it is
						commercially cultivated in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Java, in their wet tropical lowland
						climates. At higher elevations the "Bali" variety can be grown. It produces a delicious fruit,
						eaten out of hand, with a taste similar to strawberry with an apple-like texture. The fruit
						transports well and can be stored at room temperature for a week with little degradation in
						quality.

					<h2>Prepare</h2>
					<p>These palms are traditional understory species in their native forest habitat of SE Asia. The
						leaves reach 5 meters into the air, but they are not a dense plant if pruned properly.
						They are best planted under a canopy of fruit, nut, or timber species which are low maintenance
						and let through about 50% of the sun's light. This is a similar setting to shade grown coffee
						and cacao.
						The spikey nature of Salak discourages overstory species whose fruit falls to the ground upon
						harvest or must be maneuvered around easily for harvest.</p>



					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Grow</h2>
					<p>Salak plants are either female or male and are pollinated by a number of native pollinators,
						including stingless bees. But these pollinators are inefficient, with only 10 to 15 % of flowers
						producing fruit. By hand pollinating Salak, you can easily achieve close to 100% pollination.
						Female flowers are coned shaped and covered with a dense fiber sheath. As they develop over many
						months slowly remove their outer sheath. This will allow you to completely see the flower as it
						approaches maturity. Once removed from these sheaths the cone takes one to four weeks to open.
						Once open the flower reveals a deep pink color which is ready to receive the male flower.
						The male flower needs little management. When pollen is available the flower also opens up and
						reveals a pink interior, although in a much subtler way. Usually the pollen granules are easily
						visible though and stingless bees are often indicators of a ready flower.
						The male should be removed with clipperss and brought to the female plant, where it is used to
						"dust" the open female flower. This is best done in dry weather, which allows the pollen to fall
						out of the male flower with ease. It is wise to check your salak grove for receptive female
						flowers ever other day.
						Within a few days the flower will harden up if it was successfully pollinated. If not it will
						become soft and should be removed. All dead flowers, male and female, should be regularly
						removed to encourage more flowering.
					</p>

					<h2>Harvest</h2>
					<p>Plants will begin to flower at three to four years of age.
						To determine if the fruit is ready to harvest, try one from a bunch and see if the seed color
						has turned from white to brown or light brown. See color is the best way to betermine if a fruit
						is ready to pick. It is best to try fruit from the base of the bunch. If the individual fruits
						fall off of the bunch, they are likely ready.
						Pests, such as aguti, can compete for ripe fruit.
						The fruit does not ripen off of the plant.</p>
