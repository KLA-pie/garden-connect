						<h1>Bell Peppers</h1>

					<p>Freshly picked bell peppers add sweetness and a refreshing crunch to summer dishes like kebabs,
						baked peppers, salads and salsas. With a little planning and extra care, you could pick a peck
						of your own homegrown sweet bell peppers this season. If you're looking for adventure, you
						should be able to find a wide selection of colors, sizes, shapes and flavors from specialty seed
						nurseries. The only catch is that you'll need to research important considerations, including
						how long before your peppers will be ready to harvest, your chosen variety's resistance to
						common diseases and the type of bell pepper you'd ultimately enjoy eating.
					</p>

					<h2>Prepare</h2>
					<p>Site preparation begins with finding the right spot. Peppers need full sun to grow properly — at
						least six hours of direct light each day. Soil should be well drained so that roots don't become
						waterlogged, but also moisture retentive to prevent draining out. If the only spot with enough
						sunlight also has less-than-ideal soil conditions, you'll need to amend the soil or consider
						building a raised garden bed or growing bell peppers in pots. Bell peppers thrive in an
						environment that is rich in organic matter. Mix a healthy amount of compost, well-aged manure or
						cover crop residues into the bed before planting. This nutritious organic material will feed
						beneficial soil organisms as it decomposes, as well as improve water retention, drainage and
						soil texture in the garden bed.</p>

					<h2>Grow</h2>
					<p>Timing is everything when it comes to growing sweet bell peppers. These heat-loving veggies were
						first cultivated in South and Central America. While peppers grow as perennials in their native
						range and similar tropical climates, in the U.S. we grow peppers as warm-season annuals, moving
						them outdoors into the summer sunshine once nighttime and soil temperatures are consistently
						above 50 degrees.

						Although it may be tempting to plant peppers outdoors during an odd burst of 80-degree weather
						early in the spring, it's best to wait until all danger of frosty weather has passed to prevent
						any chance of cold damage. Check with your state extension service to learn when the average
						last frost date for your region is. While peppers will tolerate temperatures higher than 50
						degrees, they will perform much better in conditions above 75 degrees.
					</p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Harvest</h2>
					<p>Sweet bell peppers can either be picked green or when fruits are fully colored. Green peppers are
						usually a little tangier, while colored fruits are sweeter and more developed. Regular
						harvesting will promote more flower and fruit development — the more fruit you pick, the more
						fruit you'll get. Always use a sharp pair of hand pruners, snips or scissors to harvest peppers.
						Attempts to twist or break the fruit from the stem will almost certainly damage the plant.

						Sweet peppers taste their best when eaten fresh from the garden. Bell peppers should last about
						a week or so in the refrigerator, but if they're refrigerated too long, their skin may begin to
						pucker and sink. Freezing bell peppers is the best way to preserve a bumper crop of peppers that
						needs to be stored for more than a week.</p>
