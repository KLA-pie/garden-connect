						<h1>Cucumber</h1>

					<p>A tropical vegetable, cucumbers thrive when the weather is hot and water is plentiful. Growing
						cucumbers is for warmer weather: Plants are so frost-tender that they shouldn't be set into the
						garden until soil temperatures are reliably in the 70-degree range (no less than 2 weeks after
						the last frost date).

						Cucumber plants grow in two forms: vining and bush. Vines scramble along the ground or clamber
						up trellises, while bush types, such as Burpless Bush Hybrid, form a more compact plant.
						Generally, vining cucumbers yield more fruit throughout the growing season. Bush selections are
						especially suited to containers and small gardens. You can increase the season's yield of bush
						varieties by planting several crops in succession 2 weeks apart.

						Whether you want a cucumber for slicing or pickling, Bonnie Plants® has a variety to suit your
						taste. Lemon cucumber offers smaller fruits perfect for a single serving, while Boston Pickling
						boasts classic heirloom taste. The long Armenian cucumber is a specialty cucumber prized for
						taste and the fact that a single cucumber yields so many slices. Whichever cucumber variety you
						choose, you can rest assured that you'll get a strong start with Bonnie Plants, a company that
						has been around for over 100 years.

					<h2>Prepare</h2>
					<p>Cucumbers need warm, fertile soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.8, although they will tolerate a bit more
						alkaline soil to 7.6. To improve the soil and help create the root environment needed for a big
						harvest, work several inches of aged compost-enriched Miracle-Gro® Performance Organics® All
						Purpose In-Ground Soil into the top few inches of your existing garden soil. (Compost or
						composted manure will work, too.) Plant seedlings 36 to 60 inches apart, depending on variety
						(check the stick tag). For vines trained on a trellis, space plants 1 foot apart.

						In areas where spring is long and cool, you can warm the soil 3 to 4 degrees by covering the
						hill or row with black plastic.If you do not plant in black plastic, then mulch with pine straw,
						wheat straw, chopped leaves, or your favorite organic mulch shortly after planting. If the
						weather is unseasonably cool, you can wait a while to mulch until the ground is warmed by the
						sun. Mulch is especially important to keep the fruit clean for bush types and vines not growing
						on a trellis. Straw mulch is also thought to be uncomfortable for slugs and creates an uneasy
						footing for cucumber beetles, helping to keep them at bay.

						If you can, trellis your vines. This keeps the fruit clean and saves space. A 12- to 18-inch
						diameter cage made from 4- or 5-foot welded wire fencing or hog wire will support 2 or 3 vines.
						Wire is easy for the tendrils of climbing cucumbers to grab as the plant grows.</p>

					<h2>Grow</h2>
					<p>Cucumbers grow fast and don't demand a lot of care. Just keep the soil consistently moist with an
						inch of water per week (more if temperatures sizzle and rain is scarce). Inadequate or
						inconsistent moisture causes oddly shaped or poor-tasting fruit. If possible, water your
						cucumbers with a soaker hose or drip irrigation to keep the foliage dry. This helps prevent leaf
						diseases that can ruin the plant.

						For best results, high quality plant food is just as important as starting with great soil. You
						can fertilize with a water-soluble food by applying it directly to soil around plant stems. Or,
						you can use a
						continuous-release fertilizer worked into the soil. Both plant foods feed both your plants and
						the beneficial
						microbes in the soil that help them thrive. Either way, be sure to follow label directions of
						your soil choice.
					</p>

					<h2>Harvest</h2>
					<p>You can pick cucumbers whenever they're big enough to use. Check vines daily as the fruit starts
						to appear because they enlarge quickly. Vines produce more fruit the more you harvest. To remove
						the fruit, use a knife or clippers, cutting the stem above the fruit. Pulling them may damage
						the vine. Don't let the cucumbers get oversized or they will be bitter, and will also keep the
						vine from producing more. Yellowing at the bottom (blossom end) of a cucumber signals
						overripeness; remove the fruit immediately. Harvest lemon cucumbers just before they begin
						turning yellow. Although they are called lemon cucumber because the little oblong or round
						fruits turn yellow and look like a lemon, by the time the fruit turns yellow it may be a little
						too seedy for most tastes.

						You can keep harvested cucumbers in the refrigerator for 7 to 10 days, but use them as soon as
						possible after picking for best flavor. If you don't eat a slicing cucumber all at once, cover
						the unused portion in plastic wrap to prevent dehydration in the refrigerator. In fact, it's a
						good idea to wrap your whole cucumbers in plastic or store them in a zipper bag in the fridge to
						keep them crisp.</p>
