					<p>A rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum) is a type of fruit which looks much akin to the lychee with a
						sweet/sour flavor. It is high in iron, vitamin C, copper, and antioxidants and, while it may be
						rarely found in your neck of the woods, it is highly prized in Malaysia, Thailand, Burma, and
						Sri Lanka into India as well as eastward through Vietnam, the Phillippines, and Indonesia. The
						name rambutan is derived from the Malay word rambut, which means “hairy” — an apt description
						for this fruit.

					<h2>Prepare</h2>
					<p>Rambutan trees can be grown from seed or seedling, both of which will no doubt need to be
						obtained from an online source unless you have access to fresh fruit in your area, in which case
						you can try harvesting the seed yourself. Seed must be very fresh, less than a week old, to be
						viable and all the pulp should be cleaned from it. To grow rambutan from seed, plant the seed
						flat in a small pot with drainage holes and filled with organic soil amended with sand and
						organic compost. Place the seed in the dirt and lightly cover with soil. It takes between 10 and
						21 days for the seed to germinate. It will take about two years for the tree to be big enough to
						transplant outdoors; the tree will be about a foot (31 cm.) tall and still fragile, so it is
						better to repot it than actually put it in the ground. The transplanted tree should be placed in
						a ceramic, not plastic, pot in soil that is one part each of sand, vermiculite, and peat to
						create good drainage.

					</p>



					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Grow</h2>
					<p>Further rambutan tree care will include feeding your tree. Fertilize with a food that is 55g
						potash, 115g phosphate, and 60g urea at six months and again at one year of age. At two years
						old, fertilize with a food that is 165g potash, 345g phosphate, and 180g urea. At the third
						year, apply 275g potash, 575g phosphate, and 300g urea every six months. Keep the tree damp and
						humidity at 75 to 80 percent in a temperature at around 80 degrees F. (26 C.) in partial sun for
						13 hours a day. If you live in an area with this climate and want to move the tree into the
						garden, leave 32 feet (10 m.) between trees and the soil needs to be 2 to 3 yards (2-3 m.) deep.
					</p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Harvest</h2>
					<p>Rambutans can be harvested using a pair of pruning shears or a sharp knife. The fruit should be
						cut off the tree without damaging the stem, as this will help to preserve the fruit’s quality
						and ensure that the tree will continue to produce.</p>
